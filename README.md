# GhostLogger_X
Project Name: GhostLogger X

Description (Simple + Editable):

GhostLogger X is a stealth surveillance utility designed for educational and ethical penetration testing. Once deployed, it performs the following tasks silently in the background:

1. Keylogging:
   Captures all keystrokes typed by the user and logs them with timestamps to a hidden file.

2. Screenshot Logging:
   Takes a full screenshot every 2 seconds and stores them in an invisible system folder.

3. Startup Persistence:
   Automatically runs at every system boot by adding itself to the Windows startup registry.

4. USB Exfil Trigger:
   When a specific USB (with serial F6CF-BE46) is plugged in:
   - All keylogs and screenshots are compressed into a password-protected ZIP file.
   - The archive is dumped to the USB.
   - All traces (logs, screenshots, folders) are wiped clean from the user's computer.

5. Password Protection:
   The ZIP file is locked with a password (backgroundcharacter101) ensuring data confidentiality even during transit or storage.

GhostLogger X is a ghost. You wonâ€™t know it was ever there.
